## Environment settings
.NET SDK version = 7.0

## Running
In any shell or terminal, execute `sparse.cmd`. Before running the script, `coo.zip` in `../../data` directory should be unzipped or extracted under the same directory. Shell scripts for Windows (`unzip-all-data-windows.bat`) and Linux (`unzip-all-data-linux.sh`) are included in `../../data` directory and can be run once to facilitate the required unzipping.
