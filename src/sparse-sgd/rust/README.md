## Environment settings
Rust version = 1.75.0

## Running
In any shell or terminal, execute `cargo run --release`. Before running the script, `coo.zip` in `../../data` directory should be unzipped or extracted under the same directory. Shell scripts for Windows (`unzip-all-data-windows.bat`) and Linux (`unzip-all-data-linux.sh`) are included in `../../data` directory and can be run once to facilitate the required unzipping.
